# Hamed Ghaderi

**Full-Stack Engineer (Laravel / React / TypeScript)**  
Based in the Netherlands • Building data-heavy, business-critical web applications

I design, implement, and maintain production systems end-to-end, from backend architecture and data modelling to modern frontends.  
My focus: **clean architecture, robust domain logic, and code that stays maintainable when the product grows and requirements change.**

## ⚙️ What I’m good at

- **Backend (Core focus)**  
  - Laravel, PHP 8+  
  - Complex business logic, domain modelling, and refactoring legacy code  
  - Queues, batch processing, imports/exports, and long-running jobs  
  - RESTful APIs, auth, and integration with external services  
  - MySQL schema design, query optimisation, and indexing

- **Frontend**  
  - React & TypeScript (often with Inertia.js)  
  - Vue.js, Next.js  
  - Component-based UIs, forms, tables, filters, and dashboards  
  - State management and UX for data-heavy interfaces

- **Dev workflow / DevOps-adjacent**  
  - Docker-based development environments  
  - CI-friendly code (testing, static analysis, linting)  
  - Debugging ugly production issues and making the fix stick

## 🧩 How I work

- I prefer **clear boundaries**: feature modules, services, value objects, DTOs, etc.  
- I care about **performance** on real data sizes, not just toy examples.  
- I constantly refactor towards **simpler, more explicit code** instead of clever one-liners.  
- I’m currently deepening my knowledge in **system design, software architecture, and scaling Laravel apps**.

## 🛠 Tech I use a lot

**Backend:** PHP, Laravel, MySQL, Redis, Docker  
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vue.js, Next.js, Inertia.js  
**Other:** Git, REST APIs, testing tools, queues, background jobs

(There are more logos I could show, but skills matter more than badges.)

## 📚 Currently exploring

- Software architecture & system design for Laravel / Node ecosystems  
- Better patterns for large frontends (React + TypeScript)  
- Testing strategies that fit real-world legacy & greenfield mixes

## 💬 Off-topic interests

I can happily spend hours talking about **programming, product ideas, and fitness**, and probably bikes in the Netherlands.
